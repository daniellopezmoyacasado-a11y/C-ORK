This is a Zork Like test game.

like the original 80s Zork, the game only recognizes certain words, the list of Usable Commands are:

LOOK

TALK [NAME]

USE [ITEM]

GO (NORTH, WEST, EAST, SOUTH)

TAKE [ITEM]


In its current state it's a very small experience, but I hope you enjoy it :D

INSTALLATION

in the current state you only need to run the following command in the terminal:

$> make

and then execute

$> ./game
